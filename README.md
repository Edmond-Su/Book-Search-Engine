## Description

A Book Search Engine App that allows users to search for their desired book and save it to their profile. The app uses the google books api to resolve the user's searches and uses a graphql api server backend to allow a user to create an account and save books to their account.
The purpose of this project was to familiarise myself with Apollo servers and GraphQL. This project has allowed me to gain a better understanding of how these two work.

## Usage

If a user wishes to save a book they must create an account by clicking on the Login/Sign Up button in the top right.

Users can search for books by typing the name of the book in the search bar at the top of the screen and pressing "Enter" on their keyboard or by clicking on the "Submit Search" button to the right of the search bar.

After the search has completed, cards with the details of books that matched or were similar to the searched book name will appear. To save a book to your account click on the blue "Save this Book!" button.

To view your saved books, when logged in, click on the "See Your Books" button at the top right of the screen.
